                Each principle has to have the following:

            <p>Some text about each design principle.
                Each principle has to have the following:
                This image is from HumbleBundle, an online charity website with great deals
                on almost anything. This includes video games, coding books, and other books
                from any genre.<br>

                The website is normally full of dark colors, and has cards that are linked to 
                the current deals or normal items they sell. Items on sale or bundles have a 
                dark bottom border, and normal items  have a white bottom border. The difference
                in color makes the on sale items stand out more, catching the readers attention. 
                Also, all of the cards have a dark border that contrast well with the lighter gray 
                background of the website.<br>
