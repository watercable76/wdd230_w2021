            <h3>Proximity</h3>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">Youtube</a><br><br>

            </picture>
            <p>This image is from my browsing when I am on Youtube. Of course, the images
                that show up will be different for each person, but the layout of the site
                is the same.<br>

                Items that are close to each other have proximity, and this helps the reader
                see a connection between elements. For example, the video links are all pretty
                close to each other, and they all have the same styles. The video title is dislpayed
                to the right of the creator's logo. Then, The creator's company or channel names is
                listed, and the number of views, as well as how long ago it was published.<br>

            <h3>Alignment</h3>
            <a href="https://css-tricks.com/handling-long-unexpected-content-css/" target="_blank">CSS Tricks</a><br><br>
            <picture>
                <img class="card_img" src="images/alignment.jpg" alt="CSS Tricks"><br>
            </picture>
            <p>This image is from CSS Tricks, a website that offers insights into CSS from
                individuals who have been working in the web development field. New articles
                are published often, and they are from a variety of people, and are about a 
                variety of topics besides just CSS.<br>

                In this mobile site, we can see a clear left alignment of the paragraph text
                and the header text. There is also a certain amount of whitespace on the left
                and right of all the text, which makes it easier to read. The left aligned text
                is repeated throughout the entire article, demonstrating good usage of repetition.<br>

        <section>
            <h3>Contrast</h3>
            <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/?hmb_source=navbar" target="_blank">HumbleBundle</a><br><br>
            <picture>
                <img class="card_img" src="images/contrast.jpg" alt="HumbleBundle image"><br>
            </picture>
            <p>This image is from HumbleBundle, an online charity website with great deals
                on almost anything. This includes video games, coding books, and other books
                from any genre.<br>

                The website is normally full of dark colors, and has cards that are linked to
                the current deals or normal items they sell. Items on sale or bundles have a
                dark bottom border, and normal items have a white bottom border. The difference
                in color makes the on sale items stand out more, catching the readers attention.
                Also, all of the cards have a dark border that contrast well with the lighter gray
                background of the website.<br>
